        <p>
            I'm based in Guatemala. I studied Marketing at college and I am a certified Project Manager. I decided to have a career change because I love programming since I was in High School, back then I didn't think of having a career or building a career as a software engineer because I was afraid of not been smart enough to code, or not having enough time to study or even not been able to find a job fast enough. Today I let go of the fear and give it a try, and as soon as I open VSCode I felt beyond happy... I remembered why I use to love computer science so much. Join me in becoming a full time full stack developer.
